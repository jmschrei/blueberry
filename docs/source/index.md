![alt text](blueberry.png "Data handling with blueberry!")

blueberry implements efficient data structures for the storage, analysis,
and exploration of Hi-C datasets. Currently it supports data types for
the storage of raw Hi-C datasets, performing KR matrix-balancing,
observed/expected normalization, calculation of correlation matrices,
and calculation of the first eigenvector, as well as datatypes for
Fit-Hi-C results.

This page currently serves as an API reference for these data structures.
